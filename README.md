# cuspis - points!!!

## Project Description

# Introduction
Imagine Canada Learning Code (CLC) giving out rewards in terms of cryptocurrency and verified track of courses!! That's what we dream to build today. 

Let's consider students, parents, children who are not digitally literal and not motivated to be members of CLC. Most of them know about Scene points, Airmiles etc. and how they can reuse them for purchasing various utilties online. What if, we create some thing similar to Airmiles but its a reusable CryptoCurrency, that you are collecting in a wallet. As you are collecting, you are also learning code.. empowering yourself to become a valuable asset for future employer.. meeting people who are peers and also mentors. It's a solution tasty for everybody!!!! As users participate more they also get a clear career path, potentials jobs/earnings from the system, which is a set of guided steps followed by users similar to current profile. 

The other side of this solution is, this can be used by Employers & Institutions to evaluate user profiles and may be they get a call for the interview !! They acheive their career goal, which is the path suggested by our solution. 

Now, what does CLC get with all of this!!! Everybody needs to get rewarded.. Thats our motto :) CLC always has the trasparent view of what all users are doing. Don't forget we are using blockchain!!! They can track the events users are attending, they can track and try to counsel users more and make them understand what they can do better with this solution.

And so.. we introduce.. CUSPIS. This means points in latin. 

# Technology

1. Private Ethereum network for generating cryptocurrency token for CLC. 
2. Smart contracts verifying and validating events and courses that user is attending. 
3. Smart contracts to create certificates after certain goals are met. 
4. Machine models for prediction, recommendation and segmentation.
